# Meteoric Fall: a comet-ment to data

The goal of this project is to develop a Shiny app utilizing the Meteorite Landings dataset, enabling users to explore and analyze meteorite landings data through dynamic visualizations. This repository provides an overview of the project, its objectives, dataset information, key questions addressed, and insights gained.

[Shiny App for Meteor Landings](https://gmcginnis.shinyapps.io/MeteoriteMap/)

## Dataset

The dataset `Meteorite_Landings.csv` has been sourced from NASAâ€™s Open Data Portal and contains 45,716 observations across 10 variables (6 numerical, 4 categorical). This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of all known meteorite landings on Earth. It was chosen to explore factors influencing meteorite landings, analyze historical events, and potentially predict vulnerable locations for future impacts, contributing to multiple research fields.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of the project are as follows:

- Create an interactive platform using Shiny app to explore and analyze meteorite landings data.
- Provide users with dynamic visualizations to enhance their understanding of meteorite landings on Earth.
- Answer key questions regarding the distribution of meteor impacts across the Earth, the continents with the most accumulated total mass of meteors, and the relationship between historical events and meteor observations.
- Explore trends in the frequency, type, and location of meteorites and their correlation with known celestial events.
- Generate insights that contribute to scientific research in fields such as astrology, data analysis, and geology.

## Analysis Plan

- Distribution of Meteor Impacts
We'll use an interactive leaflet map to display the global distribution of meteor impacts, allowing users to explore specific regions. Meteor locations will be plotted using latitude and longitude data, with interactive features highlighting details like the year of the fall, mass, and classification. A density map will be created to show which continents have accumulated the most meteor mass.

- Meteor Observations and Historical Events
To explore the relationship between meteor observations and historical events, we'll create an animated line graph showing meteor observations per year, annotated with major historical events. This will help identify any correlations, such as increased meteor discoveries following the space race.

- Celestial Correlations
We'll analyze meteor data for patterns linked to celestial events like comets and meteor showers. By comparing periods of heightened meteor activity with known astronomical occurrences, we'll add visual indicators to our maps, such as color-coding meteors by the celestial event that caused them, enhancing our understanding of meteor falls in relation to Earth's position in the solar system.
